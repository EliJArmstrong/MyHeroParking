# MyHeroParking

Thank you for chacking out app. This app is an early attempt to make a social parking spot availability app.

This app is currently in development and the code will change as time goes on.
The current code was just to figure out fetures and the look of the app. Now that I understand my data base and how the functions of my iOS app the code will be refactored and cleaned up.

This is a side project IOS app to help people connect by sharing when the parking space there are going. This App uses a custom parse DB to store and share data.

Currently the app will let the user drop a parking spot and let the curreny user or other users call dibbs on the availble parking spot.
Available parking spots are in green and paring spot that are taken are red.

The lastest update of the app makes it so that only one user can claim only one parking spot at a time.
